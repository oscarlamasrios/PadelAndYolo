**Final Project of my Computer Science Degree**

Title: "Statistics obtention and visualization system based on padel videos."

Abstract:

The incorporation of new technologies in recent years in the field of sports has promoted the extraction of large amounts of information, data and statistics of value for its subsequent analysis. In this regard, artificial intelligence plays a very important role, allowing to process of such data and create tools to support coaches in their strategy, improve player practice and performance, generate personalized advertising, or analyze the weaknesses of a rival, among many other applications. Considering this context and the continuous growth of padel, we will develop a software tool that provides information of interest from the analysis of multimedia content of this sport. It is of particular interest that the player himself can make a study of his game, as he will be able to study and correct the mistakes, which during the match may have gone unnoticed. It is also important to analyze the play of a rival since it will provide information on their weaknesses that we can take advantage of during the game. Therefore, our project will result in a web application where this information can be quickly
and easily consulted.
